**Character Generator**

**Version 1.7 Update**

This update enhances character realism by incorporating age-specific height and weight ranges, as well as realistic distributions for eye color, hair color, and personality types. Additionally, it introduces input validation and confirmation for large dataset sizes, thereby improving usability and preparing the codebase for future expansion.

**Overview**

This Python script generates random character profiles with comprehensive attributes, including name, age, gender, location, physical features, and personality types. It facilitates bulk generation and outputs data in CSV format, making it suitable for further analysis or machine learning endeavors.

**Key Features**

* **Character Generation:** The script generates multiple characters based on user input.
* **Randomized Attributes:** It incorporates randomized attributes such as names, birth dates, locations, height, weight, hair and eye color, and personality types.
* **CSV Output:** The generated character data is exported to a structured CSV file, facilitating easy import into data analysis tools.
* **Summary Statistics:** The script provides summary statistics, including averages and demographics.
* **External Data Files:** The script organizes the data with external data files for names, countries, and regions.

**Getting Started**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure that the data files (male_names.txt, female_names.txt, last_names.txt, countries.txt) are located within the data/ folder.
3. Run the main.py script and specify the desired number of characters to generate.
4. Generated profiles will be saved in the output/output.csv file.

**Requirements**

* Python 3.x
* No external libraries are required beyond standard Python modules.
